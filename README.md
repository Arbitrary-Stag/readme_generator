## Installation 
To use this app you must have node installed as well as the package "Inquirer." For this assignment I specifically used the 8.2.4 version. 

## Usage
To launch the app, you need to navigate to the folder containing the code and in your terminal type "node index.js"
You will then be asked a series of questions related to your project. Once you have successfully answered all the questions you will receive a message telling you that your readme file was successfully created, or an error message if one happend to occur. The program is written to post the readme file in a folder called "example." If you wish to have the file written else where you must go into the index.js file and adjust the file location you wish for the file to be written to.
